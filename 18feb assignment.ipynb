    "Ans =  Disadvantages of API -\n",
    "            There is a lot of conveniences and advantages to APIs, but business leaders should also be aware of the disadvantages. As a single point of entry, an API is a gateway and can become a hacker's primary target. Once the API is compromised, all other applications and systems become vulnerable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nine of the top ten vulnerabilities listed in the OWASP Top 10 now mention APIs — and since APIs can be accessed over the internet, they will have all the same disadvantages as any other Internet-based resource.  APIs are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, CSRF attacks, XSS attacks, SQL injection, and DDoS attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantage of API -\n",
    "        The development of APIs has enabled many business innovations and workflow efficiencies, here’s just three of the biggest benefits of using APIs:\n",
    "\n",
    "Automation\n",
    "When using an API managed by computers, less human effort is required and workflows can be easily updated to become faster and more productive. Furthermore, new content and information can be published and shared with your entire audience quickly and efficiently across all channels. \n",
    "\n",
    "Developer efficiency and innovation\n",
    "APIs empower developers to be more productive by reusing code in complex but repetitive processes. They don’t need to start from scratch as the API specifies how to assemble software components in a program. APIs exist to make it easy to interface with other developers' applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved value proposition\n",
    "By using APIs made available by companies such as Amazon, Salesforce, or Twitter, an application can integrate those services into their own systems to make themselves more attractive to customers."
